                      planned time of proposal and keep you updated with texts and photos of the chosen spot. I have taken proposal 
                      photos while standing in Lake Michigan, on a boat, on a rooftop, on a car, in a crowded restaurant, in the 
                      bushes, in a Divvy bike stand, and in a literal ditch. Sometimes, however, I hide in plain site with a 
                      decoy.  It all depends on your chosen spot.   I love what I do and am happy to do whatever it takes to 
                      capture your special moment.
