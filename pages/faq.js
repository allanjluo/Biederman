time and keep you updated with texts and photos of our porposal spot. I have taken proposal photos
while standing in Lake Michigan, on a boat, on a rooftop, on a car, in a crowded restaurant, in the bushes
and in a a literal ditch. I love what I do and am happy to get our plan together so the big day goes
smoothly.</td>

match each others outfits. Another great tip is to get your hair and make up trial done on the day of the
engagement session.</td>

All that experience with planning proposals means that I'll have a procedure that will ensure I am not
seen and I help you arrive at your chosen spot. I can tell you when to arrive, where to park.
I also know exactly when to start taking photos. Someone without experience might start taking photos
too early and alert your significant other that something's up. Or they might start too late and miss the
magic moment. With all my planning and experience, I'll make sure nothing gets missed.</td>
